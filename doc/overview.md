# Task & Time Tracker for Teams

## Project Overview
A full-stack task and time tracking application for internal team use. This system allows employees to log their daily work activities while managers can review, approve, or reject those logs. The application includes role-based access control, validation rules, and analytics dashboards for effective team management.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django + Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: React (with Redux Toolkit for state management)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Deployment**: To be determined
